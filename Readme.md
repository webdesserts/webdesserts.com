# webdesserts.com

This is the repository for my personal website. The site is built with React, Typescript, and styled-components and hosted on the [p2p web][1].

## Getting Started

If you're wanting to build your own site based on this one, the easiest way to get started is to open the [p2p version of this website][2] in beaker browser and [fork it from there][3].

To build the site you'll need to install [npm][4] ([yarn][5] works fine as well) and run the following:

```
npm install
```

To build the project run the following:

```
npm run start
```

This will watch for changes and rebuild the website when it detects an update. If you're using Beaker Browser, you can preview the site there, otherwise the `start` command also starts a dev server at `localhost:3000`.
