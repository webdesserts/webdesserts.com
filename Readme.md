# webdesserts.com

This is the repository for my personal website. The site is built with React, Typescript, and styled-components.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll first need to install [npm][1] ([yarn][2] works fine as well) and run the following:

```
npm install
```

You can then build the project by running the `start` script:

```
npm run dev
```

This will spin up a dev server at `localhost:3000`.

For more information on available scripts you can run:

```
npm run help
```
